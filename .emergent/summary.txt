The previous AI engineer successfully transformed a basic HTML flipbook into a functional Social Weekly Newspaper Network MVP. Key milestones include implementing a full user authentication system, story submission with local image storage, a friend management system with invitations, and a flipbook-style weekly edition display. The development was highly iterative, driven by direct user feedback on features, UI/UX (e.g., text editor, RTL issues), and critical bug fixes (e.g., login errors, submission status, contributor visibility). The work culminated in fixing the contributor relationship and weekly edition generation, though the last interaction indicates a persistent issue where contributor stories are not appearing in the flipbook, suggesting a deeper problem with story retrieval or edition aggregation that requires further database diagnostics.

<product_requirements>
The user initially requested a simple flipbook-style website to display weekly news stories from a provided HTML snippet, focusing on weekly filtering and a basic page-by-page interface. This evolved significantly into a Social Weekly Newspaper Network. Key requirements now include:

1.  **User System**: Simple email/password registration for users.
2.  **Story Submission**: Users can submit weekly stories (one per week) with title, author, content, and up to 3 images. Prioritization (headlines) was requested but later de-prioritized.
3.  **Friend Network**: Users can invite up to 50 friends to be contributors to their weekly edition. Invitations should be email-based, supporting both existing and new users (auto-friended upon signup).
4.  **Weekly Editions**: Automatic generation of weekly editions every Tuesday (submission deadline Monday), compiling stories from all chosen contributors.
5.  **Flipbook Interface**: Display weekly editions in a classic newspaper-style flipbook with navigation.
6.  **Archive System**: Store and browse past editions.
7.  **Image Storage**: Cloud storage for images (AWS S3) was initially requested but deferred, with current implementation using local base64 storage in MongoDB.
8.  **UX Improvements**: Auto-save for story drafts, rich text formatting (Bold, Italic, Underline), accurate submission status display, and correct text editor behavior (left-to-right, proper cursor).

-   **Authentication**: JWT-based token management for secure user sessions.
-   **UI/UX**: Tailwind CSS for styling,  for rich text editing,  for icons.
-   **Data Management**: CRUD operations for users, stories, friends, invitations, editions.
-   **Deployment**: Understanding of session-based preview URLs vs. persistent deployment.
-   **Error Handling**: React Error Boundaries, Axios interceptors for robust error management.
</key_technical_concepts>

<code_architecture>
The application follows a standard full-stack architecture:



-   :
    -   **Summary**: The core FastAPI application handling all backend logic. It defines MongoDB models for , , , , and . It exposes REST API endpoints for user authentication (registration, login), story management (creation, weekly filtering), friend management (invitations, acceptance, listing), and weekly edition generation/retrieval.
    -   **Changes Made**:
        -   Initial setup for user, story, friend, and weekly edition models.
        -   Implemented JWT-based authentication.
        -   Added invitation system logic:  model,  endpoint to send invitations, modifications to  to handle pending invitations and auto-add contributors.
        -   Modified  relationships to include  lists for mutual story sharing.
        -   Updated  to fetch stories from contributors and potentially force regeneration, and .
        -   Added  POST endpoint for one-time data migration to convert existing friends into contributors.
        -   Implemented  for diagnosing story retrieval issues.

-   :
    -   **Summary**: Stores environment variables for backend configuration, notably  and a , and .
    -   **Changes Made**: Added  and  variables.

-   :
    -   **Summary**: The main React component that sets up routing and integrates core components like the  and . It now also wraps the application with .
    -   **Changes Made**: Implemented React Router for navigation to various pages (Weekly Edition, My Stories, Friends, Archive, Login/Register). Integrated  for global authentication state. Wrapped the main content with  to catch UI errors. Added debug route.

-   :
    -   **Summary**: Entry point for the React application, rendering the  component into the DOM.

-   :
    -   **Summary**: Provides authentication context to the entire React app, managing user login/logout, JWT token storage, and user data.
    -   **Changes Made**: Improved error handling for API calls, including network error tolerance and clearer messages. Enhanced token management.

-   :
    -   **Summary**: Renders the flipbook-style display for weekly editions, showing stories page by page with navigation.
    -   **Changes Made**: Fixed a critical bug by adding a missing  import from .

-   :
    -   **Summary**: Provides the interface for users to write and submit their weekly stories, including title, content, and image uploads.
    -   **Changes Made**: Implemented auto-save functionality for drafts using . Added rich text editing capabilities (Bold, Italic, Underline) using . Fixed text direction (left-to-right) and ensured cursor starts at the left with proper alignment. Improved form clearing.

-   :
    -   **Summary**: A new React component that acts as an error boundary, catching JavaScript errors in its child component tree and displaying a fallback UI instead of crashing the entire application.
    -   **Changes Made**: New file created to provide robust error handling for the frontend.

-   :
    -   **Summary**: A new utility file that configures Axios with global request/response interceptors to handle common API errors (e.g., network issues, session expiry).
    -   **Changes Made**: New file created to centralize API call error handling and retry mechanisms.

-   :
    -   **Summary**: Displays the user's submitted stories and provides access to the story submission form.
    -   **Changes Made**: Fixed the week calculation logic to match the backend's  for accurate submission status display. Added logic to refresh the status after story submission.

-   :
    -   **Summary**: Manages friend relationships, allowing users to invite friends and view their friend list.
    -   **Changes Made**: Updated to use the new invitation system, replacing direct add friend with invite friend functionality and showing pending invitations.

-   :
    -   **Summary**: Displays the current week's newspaper edition, fetching stories from the backend and rendering them in the flipbook.

<pending_tasks>
-   **Image Storage Upgrade**: Migrate from local base64 image storage to AWS S3 cloud storage once credentials are provided.

-   **Future Features (Discussed, not started)**:
    -   Story categories/tags
    -   Search functionality
    -   Prioritizing headlines for weekly stories (partially implemented in backend, but frontend display logic still needs work)
</pending_tasks>

<current_work>
The immediate problem is that the user's deployed application is still not displaying stories from their contributors in the weekly edition flipbook, even though:
1.  The  field on the user object (e.g., Joel Conybear) is correctly populated (e.g., ).
2.  The friends (e.g., Michael Castro, Lauren Colalillo) are confirmed by the user to have submitted stories for the current week (Week 30).
3.  The backend migration to fix existing friendships by adding them as contributors was successfully run on the deployed environment.
4.  The backend logic for generating the  was modified to force regeneration and account for recent weeks with content.

Despite these fixes and verifications (which work in the local environment and via API calls), the frontend Weekly Edition page only shows the user's own story. This strongly indicates a persistent bug in how the backend  endpoint aggregates stories from contributors, or how the frontend processes this data for display, or a caching issue that prevents the updated data from being served consistently in the deployed environment. The last action taken was an attempt to diagnose this specific problem using browser console scripts, but the user still reports only one story.
</current_work>

<optional_next_step>
Create a simple diagnostic endpoint or a more robust console script to deeply inspect the database state and the exact data returned by the  endpoint, focusing on why only one story is being retrieved.
