The previous AI engineer spent significant time (Chat 1-282) debugging a persistent contributor stories not appearing bug in the initial Social Weekly Newspaper Network application. This was an iterative, frustrating process plagued by data inconsistencies, cached frontend data, misleading testing agent reports (testing an empty database), and broken debug endpoints. Key learning involved the real problem being a mismatch between what the frontend/some API calls reported (cached data) and the actual database state (no friends/contributors).

Ultimately, the user decided to restart from scratch (Chat 280), initiating the Acta Diurna project. The AI engineer has since successfully completed:
1.  **Phase 1: Core Foundation** (Auth, basic invites, UI).
2.  **Phase 2: Story Editor & Content System** (Rich text, image upload, auto-save, submission logic).
Currently, the engineer is in **Phase 3: Flipbook Newspaper Generation**. A critical bug regarding *bidirectional contributor relationships* was identified and a fix has just been implemented in the backend. The next step is to test this fix and the overall Phase 3 functionality, demonstrating a much cleaner and more structured development approach for Acta Diurna.

<product_requirements>
The original Social Weekly Newspaper Network aimed for user registration, weekly story submission (title, content, up to 3 images), a friend network (up to 50 contributors via email), automatic weekly edition generation (Tuesday 8 AM EST), a flipbook interface, and an archive. Image storage was local (base64) with a deferred S3 plan. UX improvements like auto-save and rich text were also added.

The Acta Diurna rebuild redefined requirements:
1.  **User Invitations**: Main user invites friends (email); friends accept, then manually add the inviter as a contributor.
2.  **Story Creation**: Friends write one weekly story (headline, content, up to 3 images; rich text: bold, italic, underline; draft saving).
3.  **Submission Deadline**: Monday 11:59 PM EST.
4.  **Newspaper Generation**: Tuesday 8:00 AM EST, automatic flip book generation with all contributors' stories.
5.  **Viewing/Archive**: Flipbook viewable on site, past weeks archived.
6.  **Technology Stack**: React, FastAPI, MongoDB. Deployment target: Render.

<code_architecture>
The application, now named Acta Diurna, follows a standard full-stack architecture, built from a clean slate.



-   :
    -   **Summary**: The core FastAPI application. Manages API endpoints for authentication, user profiles, invitations, story submission, and weekly edition generation.

<current_work>
The project is currently focused on **Phase 3: Flipbook Newspaper Generation** for Acta Diurna. The immediate task being addressed is a critical architectural issue concerning **bidirectional contributor relationships**. Previously, the system struggled with correctly identifying and aggregating stories from contributors due to inconsistencies in how friend/contributor relationships were stored and queried.

The AI engineer has just implemented a fix in the backend () to ensure that  objects correctly reflect who a user is friends with and who their contributors are, including updates for the reverse relationship. This is crucial for the  and  endpoints to accurately pull stories from all relevant contributors.

For example, when User A adds User B as a friend/contributor, the database must reliably update User A's record to show User B, AND (if applicable by the Add to Contributor List requirement) User B's record to show User A. This ensures that story queries for an edition can correctly identify all associated contributors.

The backend: stopped
backend: started command has been successfully run after these code changes (Chat 339). The next step is to run a comprehensive test suite for Phase 3 to validate that this core relationship fix allows contributor stories to be aggregated and displayed correctly in the flipbook, marking significant progress towards the Acta Diurna vision.
